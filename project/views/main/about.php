    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister and I never thought that our lives would change so dramatically. Both of us had an
        economic education, Elena an economist in construction holding and Kristina a chief accountant in an outsourcing
        company.
        Then three years ago something happened that made us reconsider our lives, work, home... To get out of this rut
        we looked for some sort of distraction and by chance came across hand made teddy bears on the internet and
        became consumed by them.Apart from sewing a button on we had never even held a needle and our first attempts at
        making teddy bears were misshapen and funny, but even then we realized they were alive and part of us, our
        personalities, our mood, thoughts and joy had all been sewn in the bears as we made them. We knew that this kind
        of creativity had become the meaning of our lives. We put ourselves into the process, from the selection of
        materials, the images we used and the names we picked for our bears.Our husbands help us with advice and
        stuffing the bears with saw dust. They advised us to do individual packaging which we took on board and now each
        bear has a box created especially for him.Recently we had small children and there is not much time left for
        creativity, but we have so many ideas running around our heads that we make bears at night. We will continue to
        bring joy to the world with our teddy bears!
